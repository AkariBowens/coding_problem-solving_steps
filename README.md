# coding_problem-solving_steps
This is a repeatable, step-by-step process for solving programming/coding problems I had Claude Sonnet 4 generate in JSON.

## Prompt:
Design a system I can use to work through coding problems. Break it down step-by-step in JSON format. Highlight the focus for each step and make it applicable to all coding/programming problems, not just things like DSA practice or LeetCode.
